			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>The game consists of two pieces: a bundle of HTML, CSS and Javascript on your browser
			(the client) and a Java servlet running on a virtual machine in Microsoft's Azure cloud
			(server). When you interact with the webpage the javascript uses your input to generate
			a http request which it sends to the server. The server then decodes your action, modifies
			the game state appropriately and responds with an XML file describing the current game state.
			Finally, the client draws the game state based on the XML instructions received.

			<h3>Client Side</h3>
			<p>Before I started working on this little project I had never written CSS or javascript code, and
			I had only a passing familiarity with HTML. One of the difficulties I encountered was that each
			language has its own syntax. To cope with this I tried to strictly separate each language into 
			its own file.</p>
			<h4>HTML</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Layout. Provides elements into which javascript inserts objects describing game state.</p>
			
			<h4>CSS</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Colors (forgive me), how items look like.</p>
			
			<h4>Javascript</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Clientside logic. Communication with servlet (request game state, display game state to user)</p>
		</div>
	</div>

		<div class="col-lg-12">	<!-- First "column" for Bootstrap. -->
			<h3>Serverside Side</h3>
			<p>Before I started working on this little project I had never created a Java servlet. Thankfully
			the tutorials on the subject were highly informative and easy to follow. The servlet could easily
			be improved by storing the highscore table in an actual database, or by creating mechanisms for
			deleting games that sit unattended for a long period of time. Currently this is not necessary since
			Azure quickly shuts down the servlet while it is not in use.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4>TileServlet</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Communication with client. Holds highscore data.</p>
			
			<h4>Communicator</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Takes Java objects such as TileGame and Highscore and turns them into XML. Stores and appends to XML messages from serverside objects.</p>
			
			<h4>Generator</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Generates the game world by creating tiles, linking tiles together and assigns each tile its resources. Holds the game design of the program.</p>
			
			<h4>Tile</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Game piece. Contains information about the piece and methods for interacting with it.</p>
			
			<h4>TileGame</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Holds information about a game, such as player ID, name, score. Provides methods for the player to play
			the game with.</p>
			
			<h4>Highscore</h4>
			<p>Responsibilities: Simple data object containing the name and score of a past game.</p>
